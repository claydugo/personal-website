I built my personal site using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with the [Coder](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-coder/) theme. 

I have a custom stylesheet to modify the colorscheme to my preference. Other than that the theme was pretty much what I was looking for in terms of style. Havnt modified it too much, yet.

I'm hosting the site on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), which I have nothing but positive things to say about. Best hosting experience i've personally had. The github intergration is fantastic.
