I built my personal site using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with the [Coder](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-coder/) theme. 

I have a [custom stylesheet](static/css/stylesheet.css) to modify the colorscheme to my preference. Other than that the theme was pretty much what I was looking for in terms of style. 

I'm hosting the site on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), which I have nothing but positive things to say about. Best hosting experience i've personally had. The github intergration is seamless.
