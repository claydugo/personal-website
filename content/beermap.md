## Beer Map

This map was created on 10/17/2019. I try to update it every so often or after trips to new places. 
A more up to date list can be found on my [untappd](https://untappd.com/user/claydugo).

If on mobile, it looks much better to click fullscreen which will open it in the Google Maps app.
